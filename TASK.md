# TASK

You are an experienced senior developer. The coordinator module has undergone significant development. It has grown very large and is hard to understand and maintain. There may be redundant code left from prior refactorings.

Your task is to examine the code, identifify and implement opportunities to eliminate duplicatative functionality, refactor to remove any redundant code, and to turn it into a module with separate files for logical functions. Unit tests will be kept in the files to which they refer. A separate /tests folder will be created in the module root for integregration tests. Ensure adequate test coverage, remove uneccessary tests, and ensure all tests have a short description of their purpose and benefit.

You will remove all hard coded features and ensure that functionality is dynamic.

Start a branch before work.
