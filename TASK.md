# TASK

You are an experienced senior developer. The cache modele has undergone significant development. It has grown very large (>1500 lines) and is hard to understand and maintain. There may be redundant code left from prior refactorings.

Your task is to examine the code, identifify and implement opportunities to eliminate duplicatative functionality, refactor to remove any redundant code, and to turn it into a module with separate files for logical functions and related unit tests with a test folder for integration tests.

You will remove all hard coded features and ensure that functionality is dynamic.
