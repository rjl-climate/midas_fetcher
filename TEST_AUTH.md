# Testing Real CEDA Authentication

This guide explains how to test the real CEDA authentication functionality.

## Prerequisites

1. **CEDA Account**: You need a valid CEDA account from [https://services.ceda.ac.uk/](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/)
2. **Active Account**: Your account must be active and have access to MIDAS Open data

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Using .env file (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your credentials to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   CEDA_USERNAME=your_username
   CEDA_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. Set secure permissions (Unix/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

### Option 2: Using environment variables

```bash
export CEDA_USERNAME=your_username
export CEDA_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Running the Test

Run the authentication test with detailed output:

```bash
cargo test test_real_authentication -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## What the Test Does

1. **Loads Credentials**: Reads from `.env` file or environment variables
2. **Creates Authenticated Client**: Tests the full CEDA authentication flow:
   - Fetches login page
   - Extracts CSRF token
   - Submits login form
   - Verifies authentication with test download
3. **Downloads Test File**: Downloads a small MIDAS Open CSV file
4. **Validates Content**: Verifies the downloaded content is valid CSV data

## Expected Output

On success, you should see output like:
```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed
```
‚ùå Failed to create CEDA client: CEDA login failed
üí° Check your username and password are correct
üí° Make sure your CEDA account is active
```
**Solution**: Verify your credentials and account status

### Network Errors
```
‚ùå Failed to create CEDA client: HTTP request failed during authentication
üí° Network error - check your internet connection
```
**Solution**: Check internet connectivity and CEDA service status

### Missing Credentials
```
CEDA_USERNAME environment variable not set. Please set credentials.
```
**Solution**: Set up credentials using one of the methods above

### Rate Limiting
```
‚ùå Download failed: Rate limit exceeded
üí° Rate limited - try again later
```
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes and try again

## Security Notes

- The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials - never commit it to version control
- The `.gitignore` file already excludes `.env` files
- File permissions are automatically set to 600 (owner read/write only) on Unix systems
- Credentials are only used for authentication testing

## File Downloaded

The test downloads a real MIDAS Open file:
- **Dataset**: UK Daily Temperature Observations
- **Station**: Twist, Devon (ID: 1381)
- **File**: Temperature data for 1980
- **Format**: BADC-CSV (British Atmospheric Data Centre CSV format)
- **Size**: Typically ~50KB with ~365 daily observations

This validates that:
1. Authentication is working correctly
2. You have access to MIDAS Open data
3. The HTTP client can download real files
4. File format detection is working

## Next Steps

Once this test passes, you can be confident that:
- CEDA authentication is working
- HTTP client with rate limiting is functional
- File download capabilities are operational
- The foundation is ready for building the full MIDAS Fetcher application
